# Overclocking and Optimizing
## Overview
First of all, this page only applies to those using graphics card(s) to mine, so if you will be using an ASIC, ignore this page.  Also, this page is a bit of a misnomer for those who may be familiar with overclocking.  Typically, when you are overclocking a graphics card, you are increasing the GPU core clock and power consumption as much as possible to boost gaming performance.
In the case of crypto mining, you actually want to _underclock_ your GPU core clock.  Don't worry, I didn't lie to you with the title of this page.  You'll still be overclocking, but instead you'll be overclocking you graphics card's memory clock as far as you possibly can.  This is because an increase in memory clock increases your hash rate singificantyly more than an increase in in GPU core clock.  Since each card only has so much thermal and implicit headroom for overclocking (thermal being how far you can go without overheating, and implicit being how far you can go without encountering performance failure), we need to dedicate all of this headroom to getting the memory clock as high as possible while reducing GPU core clock to maximize profit.
## How to Actually do it
First, you need to determine if your GPU is overclockable at all.  Nearly all modern, high-end GPUs are, but a quick google search will tell you for sure.  Next, you need to select your overclocking software.  Most people like to use [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards), but sometimes using the software made by your graphics card manufacturer can yield better results.  If you have an FE (Founders Edition) card made directly by Nvidia, just use Afterburner.  If you are using an AMD card, use [Performance Tuning](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/radeon-software-performance).  The following is a list of manufacturer-specific overclocking tools for Nvidia partner cards:  
+ [EVGA Precision X1](https://www.evga.com/precisionx1/) for EVGA cards.
+ [Asus GPU Tweak III](https://www.asus.com/campaign/GPU-Tweak-III/) for Asus cards.
+ [Aorus Engine](https://www.gigabyte.com/Support/Utility/Graphics-Card) for Gigabyte Aorus cards.  Not recommended, Gigabyte simply makes bad software.  Use at your own discretion only if you have an Aorus card and nothing else will work.
+ [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards) for MSI cards.
+ [ASRock OC Tuner](https://www.asrock.com/feature/OCTuner/) for ASRock cards.  Also not recommended since it is simply a bad piece of software.

Once you have selected and installed your desired overclocking software, you need to get a benchmarking tool.  This will help you test for errors or outright failures to determine how far you can effectively push your card.  I recommend [Heaven](https://benchmark.unigine.com/heaven) by unigine.  It's free and extremely graphics intensive, making it perfect for this use case.  

The first thing you need to do is figure out how high you can push your graphics memory clock.  Start by setting your power and temperature targets as high as your graphics card wil allow you in the overclocking software.  Depending on your graphics card, you should be able to increase this value by _at least_ 200 MHz.  Do this, then run Heaven at maximum settings for at least tow minutes and see if you experience errors or an outright crash.  If you succeed, you need to begin the painstaking process of increasing you graphics memory clock by 50 MHz at a time, repeating the heaven test each time.  Once you encounter an error, back the clock off by 50 MHz and run the benchmark for significantly longer, at least 10 minutes.  If you can do this you've found your maximum memory overlcock for your graphics card.  Keep in mind that this will vary by _each individual_ card thanks to something called the [silicon lottery](https://linustechtips.com/topic/235372-what-is-the-silicon-lottery/).  Essentially, all processor chips are made of silicon which varies randomly in quality, determining how much they can be overclocked.  

Now that you know your maximum graphics memory overclock, you should write it down or save it as a custom profile in your overclocking software.  Now, it's time to optimize.  Mining is all about minimizing power consumption while maximizing hash rate in order to maximize net profits.  This is by far the most tedius step in the process, so prepare yourself.  You're going to want to reduce your GPU core clock and your power target as much as possible without taking a significant hit to to your hash rate.  You can really get into the math for how much income you are losing vs. your reduction in power cost for each and every combination you try, but this would take forever and isn't really worth the few cents you would gain compared to just following my rules of thumb.  

As a general rule, consider any drop greater than 7.5% of your initial hash rate to be significant.  So, once you have your memory clock maximized, either run a benchmark on NiceHash to determine your average hash rate, or run your mining software for about 30 minutes and monitor it to get a feel for your hash rate.  If your baseline is 100 MH/s, consider any result lower than 92.5 MH/s to be a significanmt loss.  

Now that you understand the criteria we'll be using, it's time to start the process.  First, reduce your power target by 10% and your core clock by 15 MHz.  This will be worth it in nearly all cases.  Next, start reducing your core clock by multiples of 15 MHz, running your mining software or NiceHash benchmark each time, until you see a significant drop in hash rate.  You want to do it by multiples of 15 because most GPUs increase performance in "bins", essentially meaning they only actually do anything different when they are told to do so by a factor of 15.  The bin size isn't always 15, but it is for most modern GPUs.  Congratulations, you've optimized your core clock as much as is reasonably worth doing.  

Next, you need to optimize your power consumption.  After initially reducing your power target by 10%, you should reduce it in increments of 2.5%, again benchmarking between each reduction to check for significant performance loss.  During this step, you also need to be checking your rejected speed or rejected shares.  This is the rate that your hashing proces is failing, and can be caused by a lack of available power.  This number will periodically go above zero randomly, but if it ends up going consistently above 5MH/s, you have a problem and need to increase your power target again.  COngratulations, now youve tuned in your power target and effectively optimized your mining operation.  

If you want to take things one step further, there is a final optimization process you can attempt at this point.  Now that you've reduced your GPU core clock, it's _possible_ (although unlikely) that you've freed up some headroom to increase the memory clock further.  Simply continue to repeat the steps provided above for finding your maximum graphics memory clock.  

Congratulations, you're fully optimized!  
## Thermal Considerations
Now tha you're overclocked, your GPU temperature will likely be significantly increased.  Anything between 70-80 degrees celsius is considered a "normal" temperature for crypto mining.  However, running at temperatures this high 24/7 can be detrimental to the lifespan of your graphics card.  This is especially important if you are using your gaming rig to do this, since you're going to want that to last, especially if you put a brand new $1000 dollar graphics card in it.  Realistically, anywhere between 60-70 degrees celsius should be safe for constant temperatures, but I like to keep mine below 65 degrees.  The best ways to reduce your temperature are:  
+ install an AIO or custom liquid cooler on your GPU.  AIOs are much easier and cheaper, but must be made specifically for your graphics card and don't offer the same performance as a custom loop.
+ Install more and/or better case fans.  I highly recommend any fans made by [Noctua](https://noctua.at/).  They offer the nest performance hands-down, although they aren't very pretty.  Also, you should consider that for optimal cooling performance, you should have positive pressure in your PC case.  This means that you need more intake fans than exhaust fans.  I use 5 in and 2 out and it seems to work quite well.
+ As mentioned before, you can replace the thermal paste on your GPU with a higher end thermal compound such as Thermal Grizzly's [Conductonaut](https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Grizzly-Conductonaut-Grease-Paste/dp/B01A9KIGSI) liquid metal thermal compound.  Keep in mind, however, this requires some degree of techncal skill and will **void your warranty**.  

You've reached the end of the tutorial.  Congratulations and hapy mining!
