This is a general tutorial on how you can start making passive income by mining cryptocurrency.  This is for anyone who is interested, ranging from those who already have a gaming PC and want to use it to make a little cash on the side, to those who have the capital and the drive to build a dedicated mining farm.  This guide will walk total beginners through everything they need to know to get started, and even has helpful tips for those who are already mining to step up their game and dial in their settings for maximum profits.  
This guide is broken down into four main sections, start with the first section if you're a beginner or feel free to skip to the fourth if you're already mining:  
+ [What is Cryptocurrency and Mining?][1]
+ [Getting the Right Setup][2]  
+ [Method of Mining and Software Selection][3]  
+ [Overclocking and Optimizing][4]  

## Terminology  
Throughout this guide, I will be using quite a bit of lingo that the layman may not be familiar with.  Here are some basic definitions:  
+ **Graphics card/GPU**: A graphics card is a piece of hardware installed in a [PCI-e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express) slot in some computers.  These are typically used in gaming computers and digital media workstations, since they are dedicated to boosting graphics processing power.  They are complete devices, consisting of a GPU core (like a [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) but dedicated to graphics performance) or cores, graphics memory or VRAM (similar to [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory), but again dedicated to graphics performance), a motherboard, [I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output) interfaces for connecting to a display, and integrated cooling (usually).
+ **Rig**: The term rig simply refers to any computer setup.  This may refer to a gaming PC (gaming rig) or a dedicated machine used for mining (mining rig)
+ **Hashing/Hash Rate**:  Hashing is the work done by your rig when mining.  It is measured in hashes/second, usually on the scale of Megahashes/second (MH/s).  This determines how much you can earn.
+ **Crypto**:  This is simply shorthand for cryptocurrency.  Can refer to any cryptocurrency.
+ **BTC**:  This is the abbreviated symbol for a bitcoin.  THink of it like USD for United States Dollar
+ **Overclocking**:  To put it simply, all computational devices have a core clock speed which, generally speaking, determines how much work it can do or how much information it can process in a given time span, and it is usually measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz).  One hertz means a single cycle per second.  Overclocking is forcing a device to run at a higher clock speed than it is intended, boosting performance but increasing power draw and heat production.
