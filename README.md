## Paul Kraus  
This is a general tutorial on how you can start making passive income by mining cryptocurrency.  This is for anyone who is interested, ranging from those who already have a gaming PC and want to use it to make a little cash on the side, to those who have the capital and the drive to build a dedicated mining farm.  This guide will walk total beginners through everything they need to know to get started, and even has helpful tips for those who are already mining to step up their game and dial in their settings for maximum profits.  
This guide is broken down into three main sections, start with the first section if you're a beginner or feel free to skip to the third if you're already mining:
