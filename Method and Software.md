# Method of Mining and Software Selection
## Method
There are three primary methods by which you can make money through mining:
+ Mining individually
+ Mining in pools
+ Selling your hashing power
### Mining Individually
This is the oldest and most basic method of mining, and has the _potential_ to earn you the highest profits (although it isn't likely).  In this method, you are attempting to solve blocks in the blockchain by yourself.  If you successfully solve a block, the payout is _**huge**_.  For example, with bitcoin, the initial payout per block was 50 BTC, and this payout halves every 210,000 blocks.  Since May 11th 2021, the payout per block has been 6.25 bitcoins.  As of writing this, the current value of one BTC is $54,982.90, meanign solving a single block would net you $343,643.124.  
This sounds like a lot of money for solving one little 1MB block of math, right?  The issue is, this payout only goes to the _first_ miner to solve the block.  With the millions of mining rigs out there today, your odds of being the first to solve a block with your relatively tiny mining operation are astronomically low.  This is where the other methods come in.  
### Mining in a Pool
This was the second major method of mining to come into existence, and the most commonly used in big operations or by those using ASIC miners.  In this method, you join a hige pool of other miners all attempting to solve the current block.  Each time a block gets solved by your pool, the payout is distributed among all miners in the pool proportional to the hashing power they contributed.  This _massively_ increases the odds that you will get paid each time a block is solved, but also means your payout is being slashed into a tiny fraction of what it could be, since there will be upwards of tens of thousands of other miners in the pool with you splitting it.  Still, this is a much better idea in the current day, as solving blocks individually has been virtually impossible for years.

### Selling Your Hashing Power
This is a relatively new method of making money through crypto mining, and is the method I prefer and recommend to anyone using a graphics card to mine, especially if you are using your gaming rig.  This is not _technically_ a form of mining.  Rather, you are renting out your hashing power to individuals or farms who are actually mining and making use of your hardware remotely.  There is a constantly changing market for the rates people will pay per Hash/second for each cryptocurrency.  Typically, you will be paid for your hashing power in the form of crypto, usually bitcoin.  So, the net result is essentially the same.  Your hardware is being used to mine cryptocurrency, and you are receiving cryptocurrency as a result.  The reason I think this method is often the best is because it is the most resistant to prifitability decay and requires the least effort.  The individuals or operations renting your hashing power are doing all the work to figure out how to maximize profits as algorithms and blocks evolve over time, and they are combining the power of your system with many others, similar to pool mining.  Typically all the work involved in getting started with this method consists of downloading a program and pressing "start".
