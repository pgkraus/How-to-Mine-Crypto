# Getting The Right Setup  
## Hardware Considerations  
The first thing you need to consider is if you want to create a dedicated mining rig/farm, or if you want to build a gaming computer that you can also mine with.  If you want to create a gaming PC, you're definitely going to need a solid graphics card.  If you're going the dedicated mining route, you need to decide if you want to graphics cards to mine, or if you want to use ASIC miners.  
### Graphics Cards  
  If you've decided you want to use graphics card mining, feel free to skip the following section on ASIC miners.  If you're still not sure, keep reading then make your decision.  
#### The Basics
Whether you want to mine on the side with your main gaming rig, or if you want to set up a dedicated mining rig/farm, using graphics cards as your mining hardware is an excellent option.  The way that GPUs are designed to handle work loads makes them especially efficient at solving the complex math problems involved in mining crypto.  Please, do not consider trying to use your CPU to mine as well, you will end up losing money because they are so inefficient.  Now, the question is, what graphics card should you buy?  If you're building a computer with a primary purpose of gaming and you have the budget, you should definitely consider a newer 3000-series graphics card from Nvidia or an RDNA 2 (RX 6000-series) graphics card from AMD.  The past year has seen massive improvements in GPU technology, and this generation of graphics cards has been one of the biggest performance leaps with price consideration we've ever seen.  Due to industry-wide chip shortages, these are extremely difficult to purchase, so don't despair if you can't get your hands on one.  last-gen 2000 series cards from Nvidia, Navi (RX 5700-series) cards from AMD, and even high-end 1000-series Nvidia card like the 1080 TI can still be competent for both gaming and mining.
#### Selecting the Right Card
If you're going the dedicated mining route, the main things you should consider are: how much money will the card make you per day, and how long the card will take to pay for itself.  The following is a great article from [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/) ranking the 10 best mining graphics cards based on mining performance bench marks, daily profit, price, and time to break even (pay for itself):

If that's too much to take in, my personal recommendations would be the Radeon VII for purely mining, or the RTX 3080 if you plan to game as well.  With an initial retail price of $699 (they can usually be found for significantly less, beign almost 2 years old) and potential daily earnings of $11.71 (meaning just under 60 days to brea even), the Radeon VII seems to nail the sweet spot between initial cost, daily profit, and time to break even.  The RTX 3080 is hands-down the best graphics card for gaming at its considerably reasonable retail price of $699, and it has a very high potential earnings of $13.23 per day.  Of course, second-hand prices on ebay are incredibly inflated right now thanks to shortages, so that changes what you need to consider.  You may even want to wait until these shortages are over to get into mining, or hope you get lucky enough to buy a card at retail price.  
#### The rest of the rig
If you want to make a dedicated GPU-based mining rig, you're going to need to build a whole computer with it.  This means, at the minimum, you will need a motherboard, CPU, power supply, hard drive, and RAM on top of the graphics card.  From my research, the cheapest setup that will alow full functionility including overclocking is as follows:
+ [AsRock h310cm lga 1151 motherboard](https://www.amazon.com/ASRock-H310CM-HDV-LGA1151-MicroATX-Motherboard/dp/B07PZFG21H)- $58.99
+ [EVGA GD 500W 80+ Gold Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-Warranty-Power-Supply-100-GD-0500-V1/dp/B07WC79PPN)- $49.99
+ Any old, used LGA 1151 CPU from Ebay.  Celerons and Core 2 Duos can typically be had for $40 or less
+ Any DDR4 memory.  New 4GB sticks can be purchased for as low as $25 from Crucial or G.Skill.  I recommend G.Skill as they have the least hardware compatability issues.
+ Any hard drive.  You can get a new [Western Digital Scorpio Blue 160GB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037NYQ9I?tag=pcpapi-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1) for $19.74

The CPU, RAM, case, and storage really don't matter much at all in a dedicated rig.  The graphics card will be doing all the work, and you can build a simple case out of wood aluminum extrusion.  
The total cost for this setup will be around $193.72 without the graphics card.
### ASIC Miners
#### What are they?
The other method of mining, typically used by large-scale mining operations such as those that fill entire warehouses in China, involves using a special type of computer called an ASIC miner.  This is not a general computer, meaning it can't run a normal operating system or binary files (executable programs), so these should **not** be considered if you plan to use your rig for gaming as well.  ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit, and is a purpose-built device solely meant to be used for mining.  They're so purpose-built, each miner can only mine *one* type of cryptocurrency.  So, for example, if you want to be able to switch between mining ethereum and bitcoin as the market fluctuates, this would be another reason you should *not* consider using an ASIC miner.

#### Drawbacks
On top of the downsides mentioned above, here is a list of all the major reasons why you should consider _not_ using an ASIC miner:
+ They are very expensive, typically upwards of $10,000
+ Since ASIC miners all perform mathematical calculations in a very specific way, and the complexity and nature of crypto blocks are always changing, any particular ASIC quickly diminishes in performance as more of them are out in the wild trying to solve blocks the exact same way.  So, to actually turn a profit, you really need to buy an ASIC as soon as it is released.
+ They are extremely power-hungry.  Many consume upwards of 2000 Watts.
+ Once they've outlived their useful life, they are completely useless.  This is very wasteful, and bad for the environment.
#### Selecting an ASIC
If you've decided you want to use an ASIC, you need to select the right one for your needs.  The website [asicminervalue](https://www.asicminervalue.com/) has a constantly-updating list of all ASIC miners sorted by release date, hash rate (mining power), power consumption, noise, the algorithm they are intended for (determines what crypto you can mine), and profitability per day accounting for electricity cost.  If you want a simple, low-cost option, the entire line of [antminers](https://shop.bitmain.com/) by bitmain are intended to be low-cost, entry-level, readily available ASIC miners.
## Considering Thermals
A very important consideration when planning a mining rig is that regardless of what type you build, they get _**hot**_.  Like, _really_ hot.  For a graphics card based system, the integrated cooling solution on the card may not always be enough.  Depending on the card, you may need to consider setting up a custom liquid-cooling loop inside your gaming PC, or designing a specialty high-airflow enclosure if building a dedicated GPU mining rig.  Additionally, all the heat these machines produce needs to go somewhere.  These machines will make your room or entire home significantly warmer.  This can actually help you save on your heating bill in the winter, but for the summer time, if building a dedicated farm or rig, you may want to consider building an enclosure that can route its airflow outside, or you're going to be spending a lot on A/C.  Another relatively easy and inexpensive way to increase thermal performance of a GPU is to take it apart and replace the stock thermal paste with something like Thermal Grizzly's [Conductonaut](https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Grizzly-Conductonaut-Grease-Paste/dp/B01A9KIGSI) liquid metal thermal compound.
## Considering electric costs
The final, and perhaps most important, consideration, is electric costs.  I've already touched on this a bit, but you need to do you due dilligence to ensure your setup will actually be profitable.  First, you should call your electric company or your city's utility office and ask how much they charge per kilowatt hour of electricity (this will typically be around $0.10).  Next you need to figure out either the listed power draw of your ASIC or the TDP (Thermal Design Power) of your graphics card of choice.  Now you need to do a little math.  This number will be in watts, and you need to multiply it by however many ASICs or graphics cards you will be using.  This will be your approximate rate of power consumption.  Now, you need to multiply this number by 24 to find how many watt hours you will be consuming in a day.  Next, divide by 1000 to determine how many kilowatt hours you will consume per day.  Finally, multiply this by the cost of electricity per kilowatt hour to find out the daily electricity cost of operating your machine.  Now you just need to figure out if this is more or less than your theoreticaal profit per day on the algorithm and crypto you will be mining (I will dive deeper into this later).  If it's less, you're ready to start profiting!
