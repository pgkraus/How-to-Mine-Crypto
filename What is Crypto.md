# What is Cryptocurrency and Mining?
## Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency with recognized value that can be exchanged for goods or services.  By far the most popular cryptocurrency is [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/).  It is very similar to fiat currency, in that it is backed by nothing and has not instrinsic value- deriving all of its value from what people are willing to pay for it at market.  This may sound bad at first, but it really doesn't when you consider that the US Dollar has [been a fiat currency since 1933](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).  Consider it like a stock, but with no ties to anything tangible like the performance of a company.  As we've seen in recent years, even in the stock market the actual performance of a company can be far less valuable than the simple market force of people wanting and believing in something, and therefore being willing to pay for it.  This was perfectly exemplified by the [Gamestop stock incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze).  
You may be wondering, how does crptocurrency work? Since they're digital, couldn't you just make fake bitcoins and buy things with them?  This is where the blockchain comes in.  Every time a cryptocurrency transaction is executed, this transaction is added to a long list of complex mathematical problems used to verify the legitimacy of the transaction.  These  problems are divided into "blocks" which are 1 MB in size for bitcoin.  Now youu're probably wondering- who verifies all these transactions?  Couldn't they just cheat and make themselves rich?  That's why the whole verification process is entirely decentralized, and that's where mining comes in.  
## Mining
As I mentioned above, all of these transactions need to be verified in a decentralized manner via the solving of difficult mathematical problems.  This requires a _lot_ of computing resources, and it just so happens that the graphics cards found in all decent gaming PCs are extremely efficient at solving these types of problems.  So, the continual solving of the blockchain relies on countless users all over the world all or some of the computational power of their graphics cards to aid in this solving process.  This requires significant expenditure of electricity on the part of those mining, and electricity costs money, so they must be compensated for their contribution.  So, each time a block is solved, new Bitcoins (or other cryptocurrency) are generated and paid to the first miner who solved it.  
There are other methods of mining besides using graphics cards and attempting to solve blocks on your own, and I'll go into much more detail on that in the section [Method and Software](https://github.com/pgkraus/How-to-Mine-Crypto/blob/main/Method%20and%20Software.md) later in this guide.
